Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using SVM + MobileNetV2

This project implements an efficient **image classification system** that distinguishes between **cats and dogs** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier trained on features extracted from **MobileNetV2** (a lightweight CNN). It combines the power of deep learning for feature extraction and the simplicity of SVM for fast, accurate classification.

## 🔍 Overview

- Extracts deep image features using pretrained **MobileNetV2** (transfer learning).
- Trains a **Linear SVM** on these features.
- Achieves **98% accuracy** on a dataset of 25,000 labeled images.
- Fast inference, suitable for deployment or real-time apps.
